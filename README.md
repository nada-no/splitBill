# webxdc SplitBill

A nice bill splitter for webxdc to share expenses easily. Enter "Add expense" to create a new expense and choose who are you going to share it with. In "View all expenses" you can find a register of every expense created in the app, even the deleted ones, so you can know what has happened. Select "settle up" to cancel your debt with someone that owes you money.
